Feature: One version across the workspace
  All modules share one version. The check lists each place that has another version. The set command
  changes the version of each module, the imports between modules and the version strings in the sources.

  Scenario: Read the version
    Given the text:
      """
      name = "moonrockz/smithy"

      version = "0.1.0"
      """
    Then the module version is "0.1.0"

  Scenario: A file with no version line has no version
    Given the text:
      """
      name = "moonrockz/smithy"
      """
    Then there is no module version

  Scenario: Set the version keeps everything else
    Given the text:
      """
      # A comment

      name = "moonrockz/smithy"

      version = "0.1.0"

      description = "Smithy"
      """
    When I set the module version to "0.0.1"
    Then the result is:
      """
      # A comment

      name = "moonrockz/smithy"

      version = "0.0.1"

      description = "Smithy"
      """

  Scenario: Only sibling imports change
    Given the text:
      """
      import {
        "moonrockz/smithy-syntax@0.1.0",

  Scenario: Mismatches are listed

    When I look for versions other than "0.0.1"

    Given a file "a/moon.mod" with the text:

  Scenario: A version string in a source file

  Scenario: Set changes only the version of a version file
    Given a file "apps/cli/cli_wbtest.mbt" with the text:

  Scenario Outline: Only plain X.Y.Z versions without leading zeros
    Then "<text>" is a version: "<answer>"

    Examples:
      | text       | answer |
      | 0.0.2      | yes    |
      | 1.10.20    | yes    |

      | 01.0.0     | no     |
      | 1.00.0     | no     |
      | 1.2        | no     |
      | v1.2.3     | no     |
      | 1234567890.0.0 | no |

  Scenario: The root version must be a version
    Given the text:
      """
      name = "moonrockz/x"
      version = "0.0.2-rc"
      """
    Then the root version check gives "The root moon.mod version 0.0.2-rc is not a version of the form X.Y.Z."

  Scenario: The root moon.mod must have a version line
    Given the text:
      """
      name = "moonrockz/x"
      """
    Then the root version check gives "The root moon.mod has no version line."

  Scenario: A malformed sibling import version is a mismatch
    Given a file "a/moon.mod" with the text:
      """
      name = "moonrockz/a"
      version = "0.0.2"

    When I look for versions other than "0.0.2"
    Then the mismatches are "b/moon.mod: found 0.0.02, expected 0.0.2"

  Scenario: The version type is the one in release.mbtx
    Then the version type is the one in release.mbtx

  Scenario: Version changes keep the extension ownership lock in step
    Given a file "openspec/extensions.lock.json" with the text:
      """
      {"version": "0.1.0", "files": {"schema.yaml": "12345"}}
