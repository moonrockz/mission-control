# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Typed edit inputs
The edit functions SHALL take frontmatter keys, raw YAML values, section names and log dates as values whose constructors check the rules that `check-okf-inputs` added, so that an edit receives only valid inputs and checks no rule again.

#### Scenario: Section name with a line break
- **WHEN** a caller builds a section name from `A\nB`
- **THEN** the constructor raises an error that names the line break

### Requirement: Typed planner errors
The planners SHALL raise one typed plan error that covers path refusals, edit errors and transition refusals, and the OpenSpec conversions SHALL raise one typed conversion error that covers invalid names and edit errors, so that a caller can match every case.

#### Scenario: Refused path in a plan
- **WHEN** a caller plans a concept at `/tables/index.md`
- **THEN** the planner raises the plan error case for a reserved name
