# okf/openspec Specification

## Purpose
Connect OpenSpec and OKF: read an OpenSpec tree as an OKF bundle, hold OpenSpec artifacts as native OKF concepts, and convert between the two forms.

## Requirements

### Requirement: OpenSpec tree as a bundle
The library SHALL ship an OpenSpec profile that loads an `openspec/` tree as an OKF bundle. It SHALL classify `specs/<capability>/spec.md` as a Specification, the `proposal.md` of each change as its Change, and the change's `design.md`, `tasks.md` and spec deltas as Design, Tasks and Spec Delta.

#### Scenario: Specification
- **WHEN** the tree has `openspec/specs/okf/documents/spec.md`
- **THEN** the bundle has a Specification concept for the capability `okf/documents`

#### Scenario: Change
- **WHEN** the tree has `openspec/changes/add-okf-module/` with `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` and spec deltas
- **THEN** the bundle has a Change concept `add-okf-module` (its `proposal.md`) that links to its Design, Tasks and deltas

#### Scenario: Archived change
- **WHEN** the tree has a change under `openspec/changes/archive/`
- **THEN** the Change concept has the `state` value `archived`

### Requirement: Structured OpenSpec content
The OpenSpec profile SHALL give each requirement with its name, its text and its scenarios, each scenario with its WHEN and THEN clauses, each delta with its operation (added, modified, removed or renamed), and each task with its number, text and done flag.

#### Scenario: Requirement and scenario
- **WHEN** a spec has `### Requirement: Concept IDs` with `#### Scenario: Concept ID from path`
- **THEN** the profile gives the requirement `Concept IDs` with one scenario and its WHEN and THEN clauses

#### Scenario: Task state
- **WHEN** `tasks.md` has `- [x] 1.1 Add the module`
- **THEN** the profile gives task `1.1` as done

### Requirement: OpenSpec relationships
The OpenSpec profile SHALL link each spec delta to the Specification of its capability, and each Change to the capabilities it adds or modifies, so that the link graph and backlinks work across OpenSpec content.

#### Scenario: Backlinks of a capability
- **WHEN** two changes have deltas for `okf/documents`
- **THEN** the Specification `okf/documents` has backlinks from both changes

### Requirement: Native OpenSpec types
The OpenSpec profile SHALL define native OKF types and frontmatter keys for Specification, Requirement, Scenario, Change and Task, so that an OKF bundle with frontmatter can hold OpenSpec content. Native and OpenSpec-tree forms SHALL give the same structured view.

#### Scenario: Same view
- **WHEN** a caller loads one capability from an `openspec/` tree and the same capability from a native OKF bundle
- **THEN** both give equal requirements, scenarios and links

### Requirement: OpenSpec checks
The OpenSpec profile SHALL report a requirement without a scenario, a scenario that does not use four `#` characters, a requirement without `SHALL` or `MUST`, a modified requirement whose name matches no existing requirement, and a delta for a capability that does not exist and is not added.

#### Scenario: Requirement without scenario
- **WHEN** a spec has a requirement with no scenario
- **THEN** the profile reports a finding for that requirement

### Requirement: Import from OpenSpec
The library SHALL import an `openspec/` tree into an edit plan that creates a native OKF bundle with one concept for each specification, change, proposal, design and task list, with an `index.md` and a `log.md`.

#### Scenario: Import plan
- **WHEN** a caller imports a tree with two specifications and one change
- **THEN** the plan creates concepts for both specifications and the change, a root `index.md` with `okf_version: "0.2"`, and a `log.md`

### Requirement: Export to OpenSpec
The library SHALL export a native OKF bundle with OpenSpec types into an edit plan that creates an `openspec/` tree that the OpenSpec CLI accepts.

#### Scenario: Export plan
- **WHEN** a caller exports a bundle with one Specification concept for `okf/documents`
- **THEN** the plan creates `openspec/specs/okf/documents/spec.md` with the same requirements and scenarios

### Requirement: Round trip
WHEN a caller imports an `openspec/` tree and exports the result, the library SHALL give a tree with the same specifications, changes, requirements, scenarios and tasks as the input.

#### Scenario: Round trip of this repository
- **WHEN** a caller imports the `openspec/` tree of this repository and exports it again
- **THEN** the exported tree has the same structured content as the original tree

### Requirement: Safe export names
OpenSpec export SHALL accept a `capability` or `change` value only when each path segment is not empty, is not `.` or `..`, does not start or end with `.`, does not end with a space, is not a Windows device name such as `CON`, and has no control character and none of `\ : * ? " < > |`. WHEN a value breaks a rule, export SHALL raise `InvalidName` with the key and the value.

#### Scenario: Path traversal
- **WHEN** a native concept has `capability: ../../evil` and a caller exports to `out`
- **THEN** export raises `InvalidName` for `capability`, and the plan writes nothing outside `out`

#### Scenario: Windows device name
- **WHEN** a native concept has `change: CON`
- **THEN** export raises `InvalidName` for `change`

### Requirement: Import date
OpenSpec import SHALL accept only a real calendar date in the form `YYYY-MM-DD` for its log entry, and SHALL raise `InvalidDate` for any other date text.

#### Scenario: Month out of range
- **WHEN** a caller imports with the date `2026-13-01`
- **THEN** import raises `InvalidDate`

### Requirement: Typed OpenSpec names
The OpenSpec profile SHALL parse capability paths, change names and requirement names once into values with the rules of `check-okf-inputs`, and SHALL give OpenSpec types and change states as enums, not as text. A requirement name SHALL keep the backticks of its heading.

#### Scenario: Change state
- **WHEN** the profile loads an archived change
- **THEN** the change has the archived state value

#### Scenario: Requirement name with backticks
- **WHEN** a spec has the heading ``### Requirement: Parse `okf_version` ``
- **THEN** the requirement name is ``Parse `okf_version` ``

### Requirement: Invalid OpenSpec names
The `openspec-invalid-name` rule SHALL report a name value that is not valid, a requirement heading without a name, and a `state` value that is not `active` or `archived`. The view SHALL leave out the content that has an invalid name, and export SHALL refuse it.

#### Scenario: Invalid name in a native concept
- **WHEN** a native `Specification` concept has `capability: ../x`
- **THEN** the view leaves the concept out and validation reports `openspec-invalid-name`

#### Scenario: Requirement heading without a name
- **WHEN** a spec has the heading `### Requirement:` with no name
- **THEN** the view has no requirement for it, its scenarios belong to no other requirement, and validation reports `openspec-invalid-name`

#### Scenario: Invalid change state
- **WHEN** a native `Change` concept has `state: done`
- **THEN** validation reports `openspec-invalid-name`

#### Scenario: Export of an invalid requirement name
- **WHEN** a caller exports a bundle with a native `Requirement` concept whose `requirement` value is blank
- **THEN** export raises the conversion error for an invalid name

### Requirement: Task numbers
The OpenSpec profile SHALL parse a task number as dot-separated positive integers and SHALL order task numbers by their numbers, so that `1.2` comes before `1.10`. A task without a number SHALL have no number.

#### Scenario: Numeric order
- **WHEN** a task list has the tasks `1.10` and `1.2`
- **THEN** `1.2` orders before `1.10`

### Requirement: Complete renames
The OpenSpec profile SHALL give a rename only when it has both a from name and a to name, and SHALL report a rename with one part as a finding.

#### Scenario: Rename without TO
- **WHEN** a `RENAMED Requirements` section has `- FROM: X` and no `TO:` line
- **THEN** the view has no rename for `X` and validation reports `openspec-rename-incomplete`
